Release: ipmiComm-R4-0-2

- drvMch.c: drvMchInit: Initialize FRU/Mgmt entity memory allocated flag 'entityAlloc' to 0
  for every FRU/Mgmt. Previously incorrectly only performed for first of each.
  mchCnfgReset: Check if FRU/Mgmt exists before memory operations
  drvMchInit: Increase pause to wait for online status from 2 seconds to 5 (PING_PERIOD)
- drvMchMsg.c: If IPMI sequence number greater than expected, store new number.
- drvMchPicmg.c: ATCA: Associate AMC sensors with corresponding front board.
- devMch.c: read_longin: Verify MCH communication is initialized before reading

14Jun2017 (SH)
Release: ipmiComm-R4-0-1

- drvMch.c: Add single read of sensors when MCH goes offline in order to update
  sensor PV severities (otherwise they remain 'green'). 
- drvMch.c/h, devMch.c, system_common.db: Add mbbo record to override sensor
  scan period. Default is 10 seconds. (PAL had trouble at 10-second rate, so this
  would allow increased scan period in a case like that.) 
- ipmiComm/Db/Makefile and shelf_atca_7slot.substitutions: rename fru_atca_amc.db
  to fru_atca_fb.db which makes sense for ATCA architecture (should have been done
  in ipmiComm-R4-0-0 with related changes, but it was missed).
- configure/RELEASE_SPEAR: include Kristi's addition of SPEAR-specific iocAdmin module
- Fix lingering compiler warnings

02Jun2017 (SH)
Release: ipmiComm-R4-0-0

* N.B: * 
* Not tested with Vadatech MicroTCA MCH *
* Workaround in place for Advantech non-increasing sequence numbers *

Many many changes. 

- Add support for ATCA systems, which includes support for 
  associated entitities
- Add support for Advantech server (combine with Supermicro in 'ServerPc')
- Move architecture and vendor specific functionality to callbacks
- Change memory allocations to be static and at init with these exceptions:
--- mchSys->sens array. Sizes can vary wildly based on architecture, so
    alloc/realloc at init, then free before subsequent configuration re-reads.
--- Temporary blocks of memory that are immediately freed
--- FRU and MGMT 'associated entities' arrays; these are also alloc-ed at init,
    then freed on subsequent configuration re-reads
- Add facility-specific database with accompanying subroutine. Used to
  translate ipmiComm device types to LCLS IOCManager values
- configure/CONFIG - change to static build for testing 

28May2016 (SH)
Release: ipmiComm-R3-0-2

-To avoid 10 second scan task over-runs (seen at PAL), change sensors
 to scan on i/o event and trigger processing from mchPing routine
 every 20 seconds
-Comment out a couple warnings that happen regularly and so are confusing

Changes to
Db/sensor_ai.db
src/devMch.c
src/drvMch.c
src/drvMch.h
src/ipmiMsg.c

26May2016 (SH)
Only process sensor records when 'present'. Change to:
Db/sensor_ai.db

16May2016 (SH)
configure/RELEASE: Use asyn-R4-25_1-0

27Apr2016 (SH)

src/drvMch.c: Restrict debug verbosity on startup to only during
              initial connection and identifying device

Release: ipmiComm-R3-0-0

18Apr2016 (SH)

Many many changes. Refactor code to support non-MicroTCA systems,
to determine (instead of hard-code) message lengths, offsets, etc.
based on system type and properties. Add support for Supermicro
server. Change privilege level to Operator (from Administrator). 
PV name changes but aliases added for backward compatibility.

*NOTE* that none of this has yet been tested with a Vadatech MCH 
MicroTCA system. 

Release: ipmiComm-R2-0-4

22Feb2016 (SH)

src:
 -  Remove createAsynUser. Not needed and apparently creates
    memory leak when used with syncio writeread.

configure/RELEASE, ipmiCommApp/Db, and ipmiCommApp/src/Makefile:
 - add suppport for iocAdmin

04Nov2014 (SH)

src:
 -  Decode data format for sensor values and limits and then convert as needed
    Changes to devMch.c, ipmiDef.h

14Oct2014 (SH)

src:
 -  Began support to read sensor thresholds but left inactive for now
    (MCH does not respond to threshold query for discrete sensors and
    this is causing out-of-order sequence numbers and timeouts)
 -  Add support to detect and store data for Management Controller Devices
    in SDR. 
 -  Read, store, and print ipmi version supported by device.
 -  Add support for NAT hot swap sensors. There is a problem with their
    sensor numbers, so current work-around is to parse sensor string 
    in order to find associated FRU
Db/shelf.substitutions:
 -  Add support for more FRUs


Release: ipmiComm-R2-0-1

27Jan2014 (SH)
Minor changes, including changes to build on RHEL64 and for SPEAR
 - src/devMch.c: Ignore status from ipmiMsgColdReset; it will always 
   return an error. (Aspects of this can be improved; added to TODO LIST)
 - src/drvMchMsg.c: mchMsgWriteReadHelper: Fix casting types, remove
   redundant debug messages
 - New file configure/RELEASE_SPEAR
 - New archive request template Db/shelf_archive_request_template
   Update README accordingly
 

Release: ipmiComm-R2-0-0

15Nov2013 (SH)
Major changes to handle dynamic changes in system configurations and MCHs
  that are offline at boot. Also separate MCH-specific and IPMI-specific
  routines, etc.
  - Db:
     -No longer generate record list at init; instead load full subset
      of possible records. Now ioc only needs to load shelf.db for each 
      system.
     -Increase number of sensors; changes to module_basic.sub, module_cu.sub,
      module_pm.sub
     -Change record INP/OUT fields from VME_IO to CAMAC_IO (more fields);
      specify fru, sens typ, sens instance instead of sensor index
     -Use sensor_ai.db; remove sensor type specific dbs
     -Lots of reorganizing...
  - src:
     -drvMch.h/c: Move MCH-specific defines from ipmiDef.h to .h; move mchSys 
      struct into mchData struct; add new MCH status MASK, remove old status 
      variables; remove unused mchFruDiff; new routines to periodically detect 
      system configuration changes and update our data structs; move 
      mchSensorFruGetInstance, mchIdentify frobsolete drvMchUtil.c/.h;
      move msg sequence number init to new routine and call it before mchIdentiy
      (otherwise VT MCH doesn't respond)
     -new drvMchMsg.c/.h: contains mch/microtca-specific message routines and 
      defines, moved from ipmiMsg.c/.h and ipmiDef.h
     -ipmiDef.h: move mch/microtca-specific defines to drvMchMsg.h
     -remove drvMchUtil.c/.h 
     -ipmiMsg.c/.h: move mch/microtca-specific stuff to drvMchMsg.c/.h; remove 
      debug routine and registration (now EPICS PV); add responseLen arg to 
      ipmiMsgWriteRead
     -devMch.c/.h: change from vmeio to camacio (more args); incorporate new 
      mch status mask; sensor number (not address) is now indexed by fru, 
      sensor type, and sensor type instance (so that it can be dynamic and no 
      longer needs to be hardcoded in db); use sensor's specified units (no 
      longer convert to slac-preferred units because it can be confusing if 
      value is 0.0, which seems to mean non working, and we display it as 32.5,
      for example); break out common dev sup init tasks to separate routines; 
      launch routine to check if our mch 'configuration' is up to date; set 
      previously static values (fru info) to be scanned on interrupt when we 
      detect new configuration; 
  - Update README

Release: ipmiComm-R1-6-0

04Jun2013 (SH)
Reduce time to initialize MCH, mostly by reducing number of read timeouts:
  drvMch.c: mchSdrGetDataAll: call ipmiMsgGetSdr twice, first to get
    record length, second to read only that length (eliminates those read timeouts)
  Define 'max' sensor read timeout and use that first time calling 'get
    sensor reading' for each sensor (reduces read timeouts)
  ipmiDef.h, ipmiMsg.h, ipmiMsg.c, drvMchUtil.c: misc changes to support above
Abort mchSdrGetDataAll for excessive read errors 

Release: ipmiComm-R1-5-1

04Jun2013 (SH)
Hot swap sensor implementation under NAT is not consistent among modules;
  no longer load hot swap sensor database. Changes:
  drvMchUtil.c, devMch.c

03Jun2013 (SH)
Use manufacturer ID from Get Device ID command to distinguish NAT and Vadatech 
  MCHs; no longer use MAC address. Changes:
    ipimDef.h, ipmiMsg.h: Add definitions for Get Device ID command and for
      vendor manufacturer ID values
    ipmiMsg.c: Test/fix Get Device ID command (previously unused)
    drvMchUtil.c: Change mchIdentify to use manufacturer ID instead of MAC 
      address to identify MCH vendor
    drvMch.c: mchInit: Abort MCH initialization if mchIdentify returns error
    
Release: ipmiComm-R1-5-0

16May2013 (SH)
Many changes, primarily to add support for NAT MCH.
NAT and Vadatech use different message protocols, so:
-Added MCH type (vendor) to data structure and Db
-Determine MCH type using node name and MAC address from /proc/net/arp
-Added type-specific defines, message routines, helper routines
-When reading from MCH, use type-specific offsets into message
-Add support for second-bridged messages (used by some NAT PICMG msgs)
-Replace sensor_hotswap.db with sensor_hotswap_vt.db and sensor_hotswap_nat.db

Other changes:
ipmiMsg.c: Have all msg routines call ipmiWriteReadHelper (even outside 
  of a session); augment ipmiCompletionCode
ipmiDef.c: Change user name to null from 'admin' because latest VT FW
  no longer supports 'admin'

Release: ipmiComm-R1-4-1

08Oct2012 (SH)
devMch.c: When reading sensor value, check that scanning is enabled.
  Else, set record READ/INVALID.
ipmiDef.h: Fix IPMI_SENSOR_SCANNING_DISABLED(x) macro
drvMch.h: Add FRU chassis struct

Release: ipmiComm-R1-4-0

02Oct2012 (SH)
Add PICMG Get Power Level message
  Changes to ipmiMsg.c/.h, ipmiDef.c/.h
Add records and device support to get FRU power levels and info
  Changes to src/devMch.c and Db/module.db
Revive module_cu.db 
Set FRU ID in devSup INP field Card number (not Signal)
Print non-zero completion code information
  Changes to ipmiMsg.c, ipmiDef.h
  New routine ipmiCompletionCode
  Add command and network function arguments to ipmiWriteReadHelper;
    pass these arguments from most ipmi message routines
ipmiMsg.c: ipmiWriteReadHelper: if non-zero completion code, return
  value of code
drvMch.c: during FRU data read if error returned is 'sensor/data
  not present', abort read

01Oct2012 (SH)
src/drvMch.c: Sensor addresses can change when system power cycled, 
  even if FRU configuration is unchanged. Thus if we detect
  MCH was offline, set communication status to 'not initialized'.
src/ipmiMsg.c: ipmiMsgWriteReadHelper: reorganize routine; do not
  check asyn status from ipmiMsgWriteRead; check session sequence number
  in first response (often in send message response) so that NAT and MCH
  checks can be identical (NAT sends one message only).  

27Sep2012 (SH)
NETFN macros no longer include LUN; break LUN and NetFn out. 
Rename IPMI_MSG1_NETFNLUN_OFFSET IPMI_MSG1_NETFN_OFFSET
Changes to src/ipmiDef.c, ipmiDef.h, ipmiMsg.c

Release: ipmiComm-R1-3-3

24Sep2012 (SH)
Check sensor 'reading/state available' before copying
  sensor reading to PV. Changes to:
  src/devMch.c, ipmiDef.c

Release: ipmiComm-R1-3-2

21Sep2012 (SH)
Set message seq number in request and verify response contains same number
  Changes to src/drvMch.c and src/ipmiMsg.c
Handle error returned from SDR read
  Change to src/drvMch.c

Release: ipmiComm-R1-3-1

21Sep2012 (SH)
Fix FRU board and part serial number data type: should be string instead of number
  Changes to Db/module.db and src/devMch.c

27Aug2012 (SH)
src/drvMch.c/.h - Break mchData struct into mchSess (session-related) and mchSys
  (system data). If system was offline, check that all installed FRUs are the same.
   If they are not, set "not initialized" flag, which sets sensor records to INVALID.
src/ipmiMsg.c/.h - Return asyn status from all msg routines. Use mchSess struct
   instead of mchData. Count msg errors, when reaches 10, restart session.
src/devMch.c and ipmiComm.dbd - Add devBiMch bi support with i/o scan support.
   Add support for "initialized" record. Use mchSess/mchSys instead of mchData.
Db/shelf_default.db - New INIT and INITBYP records to reflect if the saved 
   system configuration matches the actual system configuration. Change STAT to bi.

14Aug2012 (SH)
Add PV to enable/disable communication with MCH. Disable closes session.
  Change device support so that it checks enable/disable before sending message.
  Changes to drvMch.h, ipmiMsg.h, devMch.c, shelf_default.db
Increase reply timeout during init, change to drvMch.c

13Aug2012 (SH)
src/ipmiMsg.c/.h - When possible, specify expected msg response length so that 
  we don't have to wait for timeout. Return actual response length to be saved 
  for later write/reads. Keep track of incoming msg sequence numbers. 
  ipmiMsgWriteReadHelper: check msg sequence number and completion code, 
  return status. ipmiMsgReadSensor: add expected msg response length argument. 
  New routine ipmiSetDebug to set debug message flag. Register for ioc shell.
src/drvMch.c - mchPing was not locking mutex properly, fixed. Call asyn connect
  in mchInit. Intialize msg arrays to 0. Remove unneeded malloc/free. Save
  sensor read msg lengths into data structure for use later. 
  mchInit: Always call sensorFruRecordScript, even if device offline in order
  to load the default shelf records.
src/drvMch.h - Add timeout to mchData structure, for asyn reads
src/drvMchUtil.c/.h - sensorFruRecordScript: add argument to indicate device 
  online/configured. If it is not, load only shelf records.
src/devMch.c - In sensor reads, pass expected response length as argument. Check
  return status before setting record val/status. Remove unneeded malloc/free.
  read_mbbi: set reading in rval (not val) and return 0 instead of NO_CONVERT.
  Add debug print statements.
src/ipmiDef.h - Add reply message lengths. Add from-MCH sequence number offset and 
  lengths.
src/ipmiComm.dbd - register drvIpmiRegisterCommands
Db/sensor*.db - Change sensor record scan rate from 5 second to 10 second
Db/module_cu_default.sub - Add sixth fan speed sensor to defaults
