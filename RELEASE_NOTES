ipmiComm-R2-0-1:  Copy base RULES.Db patch to Makefile/Db so build works on all
                    systems. Changes to support SPEAR and to build in RHEL64. 
                    Add PV archiving intructions.
                    See Changelog for details

ipmiComm-R2-0-0:  Major changes, mostly to handle dynamic configuration changes
                    See Changelog for details

ipmiComm-R1-6-0:  Significantly reduce MCH init time by eliminating read 
                    timeouts where possible. Abort mchSdrGetDataAll for
                    excessive read errors.
                  
ipmiComm-R1-5-1:  Use manufacturer ID to distinguish NAT and Vadatech MCHs
                  No longer implement hot swap sensors for NAT, as they
                    are not implemented consistently among modules
		  See Changelog for more detail

ipmiComm-R1-5-0:  Many changes to support NAT MCH (in addition to Vadatech)
                    See Changelog for more detail

                    sensor reading to PV. Changes to src/devMch.c and src/ipmiDef.c

ipmiComm-R1-4-0:  Add PICMG Get Power Level message and related EPICS records
                  If system was offline, set flag to "not initialized" 
                    (sensor addresses can change with no HW change)
                  Misc changes other changes; see Changelog for details

ipmiComm-R1-3-3:  Check sensor 'reading/state available' before copying
                    sensor reading to PV. Changes to src/devMch.c and src/ipmiDef.c

ipmiComm-R1-3-2:  Set message seq number in request and verify response contains same number
                    Changes to src/drvMch.c and src/ipmiMsg.c
                  Handle error returned from SDR read
                    Change to src/drvMch.c

ipmiComm-R1-3-1:  Fix FRU board and part serial number data type: should be string instead of number
                    Changes to Db/module.db and src/devMch.c

ipmiComm-R1-3-0:  Use "initialized" flag to reflect whether our saved system 
                  configuration matches the actual configuration. If we detect that 
                  the system has just come back online, check hw configuration.
                  If there have been any changes, set flag to "not initialized". 
                  Misc other changes; see Changelog.

ipmiComm-R1-2-0:  Many changes. See Changelog for more details.
                  Determine and specify expected response msg lengths to avoid timeouts, 
                  where possible.
                  Keep track of incoming msg sequence numbers.
                  Set errors based on seq numbers, completion code, asyn status.
                  Add PV and device support to enable/disable communication with MCH.
                  Various fixes, clean-up.
