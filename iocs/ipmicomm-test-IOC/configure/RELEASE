# RELEASE - Location of external support modules
#
# IF YOU CHANGE ANY PATHS in this file or make API changes to
# any modules it refers to, you should do a "make rebuild" in
# this application's top level directory.
#
# The EPICS build process does not check dependencies against
# any files from outside the application, so it is safest to
# rebuild it completely if any modules it depends on change.
#
# This file is parsed by both GNUmake and an EPICS Perl script,
# so it may ONLY contain definititions of paths to other support
# modules, variable definitions that are used in module paths,
# and include statements that pull in other RELEASE files.
# Variables may be used before their values have been set.
# Build variables that are NOT used in paths should be set in
# the CONFIG_SITE file.

# modules this app depends upon. this builds a search path for libraries, header files, db files.
# ==========================================================
# Define the version strings for all needed modules
# Use naming pattern:
#   FOO_MODULE_VERSION = R1.2
# so scripts can extract version strings
# Don't set your version to anything such as "test" that
# could match a directory name.
# ==========================================================
ASYN_MODULE_VERSION=R4.39-1.0.2

# ==========================================================
# Define module paths using pattern
# FOO = $(EPICS_MODULES)/foo/$(FOO_MODULE_VERSION)
#  or
# FOO = /Full/Path/To/Development/Version
# ==========================================================
ASYN=$(EPICS_MODULES)/asyn/$(ASYN_MODULE_VERSION)
IPMICOMM=$(TOP)/../..

# =====================================================================
# Set EPICS_BASE last so it appears last in the DB, DBD, INCLUDE, and LIB search paths
# ====================================================================
EPICS_BASE=$(BASE_SITE_TOP)/$(BASE_MODULE_VERSION)

# These lines allow developers to override these RELEASE settings
# without having to modify this file directly.
